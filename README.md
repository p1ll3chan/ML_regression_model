# ML Regression Model

> A collection of Machine Learning Regression models and workflow to train, evaluate, and compare regression algorithms on real datasets.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains implementations of various **regression models** applied to datasets (e.g., `auto-mpg.csv`).  
It includes Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the full ML workflow:

✔ Data loading & preprocessing  
✔ Model training  
✔ Prediction & evaluation  
✔ Results comparison

*No description was originally provided in the repo — this README fills that gap.*

## 🛠️ Regression Models Covered

Implemented models include (but are not limited to):

- **Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Lasso & Ridge Regression**
- **Support Vector Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **MLP (Neural Network) Regression**

These types of regression allow you to model and predict continuous outcomes using different algorithms and complexity levels. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
