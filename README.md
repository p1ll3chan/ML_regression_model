## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains implementations of various **regression models** applied to datasets (e.g., `auto-mpg.csv`).  
It includes Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating the full ML workflow:

✔ Data loading & preprocessing  
✔ Model training  
✔ Prediction & evaluation  
✔ Results comparison

*No description was originally provided in the repo — this README fills that gap.*
